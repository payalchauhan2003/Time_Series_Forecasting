# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using LinearRegression and Naive models. The notebook provides step-by-step analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques for time series data.

## Features
- Load and preprocess time series data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Check for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- Apply seasonal decomposition
- Build and evaluate an LinearRegression model
- Train and evaluate an Naive model for forecasting

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to analyze and forecast time series data.

## Project Structure
```
|-- Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb  # Main Jupyter Notebook
|-- gold_monthly_csv.csv           # CSV file used
|-- README.md                      # Project documentation
```

## Results
- Generates EDA visualizations for time series data
- LinearRegression and Naive models are trained and evaluated with error metrics
